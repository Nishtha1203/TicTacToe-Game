I have investigated the principles of user interaction, game logic implementation, and Java programming by creating this Java-based version of the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe. The project's goal is to provide an intuitive user interface that makes it easy for players to participate in the game while preserving the essential elements that have made Tic-Tac-Toe a classic.
In this project, I have created a virtual 3x3 grid that serves as a battle�eld for the game.It has features to stop invalid moves, and detect draw match conditions or winning conditions (players alternately place their marks, X or O, onto the grid in an attempt to create a winning combination of three consecutive marks in a row, column, or diagonal). All of these features ensure a fun and equitable gaming experience.
The project explores the complexities of game logic in addition to the game's visual representation. In order to provide a fair and entertaining gaming experience, it includes methods to detect winning circumstances, identify stalemates, and prevent invalid moves.
